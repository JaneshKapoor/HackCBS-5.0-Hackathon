# HackCBS-5.0-Hackathon
This is a repository created for the submission of HackCBS for team Spambots

What are we trying to do???
We are trying to enhance the learning experience of the students by using Augmented Reality (AR) technology and trying to bring a revolution in the education sector. We totally admit the fact that some students have a very good grasping power and can visualize things that they are learning but most of the students are not able to visualize what they are trying to learn and hopefully we will be able to change that.

Why are we different???
A Few years back, most students learned from the blackboard approach, then a revolution came wherein applications like YouTube and Byjus started using graphics and animations which made learning easier than before. 
Now we are coming up with an all-new solution that will not only use animations but bring core concepts directly to your surroundings using AR.

What Tech Stack did we use???
Unity one, C#, Vuforia engine, Image detection and tracking, Figma
